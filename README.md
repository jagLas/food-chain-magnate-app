# food-chain-magnate-app

## About

This repository holds the code for a full stack app to manage and store game information, such as sales, totals, milestones, for the board game [Food Chain Magnate by Splotter Spellen](https://www.splottershop.com/products/food-chain-magnate). This app is intended to work as a compainion app to the board game, and cannot be used as a standalone game.

## How to run

This project requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run. Once Docker has been installed, copy the repisotory and run docker-compose up to start up the db, api, and frontend in a development environment.

## Work in Progress

This app's development is still in progress and does not currently have all features necessary to use it in a game.
